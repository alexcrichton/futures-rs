// FuturesUnordered is implemented using two linked lists. One which links all
// futures managed by a `FuturesUnordered` and one that tracks futures that have
// been scheduled for polling. The first linked list is not thread safe and is
// only accessed by the thread that owns the `FuturesUnordered` value. The
// second linked list is an implementation of the intrusive MPSC queue algorithm
// described by 1024cores.net.
//
// When a future is submitted to the set a node is allocated and inserted in
// both linked lists. The next call to `poll_next` will (eventually) see this
// node and call `poll` on the future.
//
// Before a managed future is polled, the current task's `Waker` is replaced
// with one that is aware of the specific future being run. This ensures that
// task notifications generated by that specific future are visible to
// `FuturesUnordered`. When a notification is received, the node is scheduled
// for polling by being inserted into the concurrent linked list.
//
// Each node is wrapped in an `Arc` and thereby atomically reference counted.
// Also, each node contains an `AtomicBool` which acts as a flag that indicates
// whether the node is currently inserted in the atomic queue. When the future
// is notified, it will only insert itself into the linked list if it isn't
// currently inserted.
