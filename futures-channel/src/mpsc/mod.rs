//! A multi-producer, single-consumer queue for sending values across
//! asynchronous tasks.
//!
//! Similarly to the `std`, channel creation provides [`Receiver`](Receiver) and
//! [`Sender`](Sender) handles. [`Receiver`](Receiver) implements
//! [`Stream`](futures_core::Stream) and allows a task to read values out of the
//! channel. If there is no message to read from the channel, the current task
//! will be awoken when a new value is sent. [`Sender`](Sender) implements the
//! `Sink` trait and allows a task to send messages into
//! the channel. If the channel is at capacity, the send will be rejected and
//! the task will be awoken when additional capacity is available. This process
//! of delaying sends beyond a certain capacity is often referred to as
//! "backpressure".
//!
//! Unbounded channels (without backpressure) are also available using
//! the [`unbounded`](unbounded) function.
//!
//! # Disconnection
//!
//! When all [`Sender`](Sender)s have been dropped, it is no longer
//! possible to send values into the channel. This is considered the termination
//! event of the stream. As such, [`Receiver::poll_next`](Receiver::poll_next)
//! will return `Ok(Ready(None))`.
//!
//! If the [`Receiver`](Receiver) handle is dropped, then messages can no longer
//! be read out of the channel. In this case, all further attempts to send will
//! result in an error.
//!
//! # Clean Shutdown
//!
//! If the [`Receiver`](Receiver) is simply dropped, then it is possible for
//! there to be messages still in the channel that will not be processed. As
//! such, it is usually desirable to perform a "clean" shutdown. To do this, the
//! receiver will first call `close`, which will prevent any further messages to
//! be sent into the channel. Then, the receiver consumes the channel to
//! completion, at which point the receiver can be dropped.

// At the core, the channel uses an atomic FIFO queue for message passing. This
// queue is used as the primary coordination primitive. In order to enforce
// capacity limits and handle back pressure, a secondary FIFO queue is used to
// send wakers for blocked `Sender` tasks.
//
// The general idea is that the channel is created with a `buffer` size of `n`.
// The channel capacity is `n + num-senders`. Each sender gets one "guaranteed"
// slot to hold a message. This allows `Sender` to know for a fact that a send
// can be successfully started *before* beginning to do the actual work of
// sending the value. However, a `send` will not complete until the number of
// messages in the channel has dropped back down below the configured buffer
// size.
//
// Note that the implementation guarantees that the number of items that have
// finished sending into a channel without being received will not exceed the
// configured buffer size. However, there is no *strict* guarantee that the
// receiver will wake up a blocked `Sender` *immediately* when the buffer size
// drops below the configured limit. However, it will almost always awaken a
// `Sender` when buffer space becomes available, and it is *guaranteed* that a
// `Sender` will be awoken by the time its most recently-sent message is
// popped out of the channel by the `Receiver`.
//
// The steps for sending a message are roughly:
//
// 1) Increment the channel message count
// 2) If the channel is at capacity, push the task's waker onto the wait queue
// 3) Push the message onto the message queue
// 4) If a wakeup was queued, wait for it to occur
//
// The steps for receiving a message are roughly:
//
// 1) Pop a message from the message queue
// 2) Pop a task waker from the wait queue
// 3) Decrement the channel message count
//
// It's important for the order of operations on lock-free structures to happen
// in reverse order between the sender and receiver. This makes the message
// queue the primary coordination structure and establishes the necessary
// happens-before semantics required for the acquire / release semantics used
// by the queue structure.
