/// A type of futures-powered synchronization primitive which is a mutex between
/// two possible owners.
///
/// This primitive is not as generic as a full-blown mutex but is sufficient for
/// many use cases where there are only two possible owners of a resource. The
/// implementation of `BiLock` can be more optimized for just the two possible
/// owners.
///
/// Note that it's possible to use this lock through a poll-style interface with
/// the `poll_lock` method but you can also use it as a future with the `lock`
/// method that consumes a `BiLock` and returns a future that will resolve when
/// it's locked.
///
/// A `BiLock` is typically used for "split" operations where data which serves
/// two purposes wants to be split into two to be worked with separately. For
/// example a TCP stream could be both a reader and a writer or a framing layer
/// could be both a stream and a sink for messages. A `BiLock` enables splitting
/// these two and then using each independently in a futures-powered fashion.

/// IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
/// ======================
/// 
/// Token system
/// ------------
/// It is necessary to protect the unsynchronised parts of the data structure
/// (tasks, value) from concurrent access by both sides of the BiLock.
/// To achieve this, there are three "tokens" numbered 0, 1, 2. At any given
/// time, each side of the BiLock owns one of these tokens, and the remaining
/// token is free. To access an element in the task array or the value, the
/// corresponding token must be owned:
///  ___________________
/// | TOKEN |   FIELD   |
/// |_______|___________|
/// |     0 |  tasks[0] |
/// |     1 |  tasks[1] |
/// |     2 |   value   |
/// |_______|___________|
/// 
/// If one side of the BiLock owns the token "2", then it has taken the lock.
/// If the token "2" is free, then neither side has taken the lock.
/// 
/// State encoding
/// --------------
/// The ownership of the tokens is encoded entirely within the state field,
/// which allows it to be updated atomically.
/// 
/// The "LEFT" and "RIGHT" columns indicate which token is owned by each side
/// of the BiLock, and the "FREE" column shows the remaining token:
///  _________________________________
/// | state % 6 | LEFT | FREE | RIGHT |
/// |___________|______|______|_______|
/// |         0 |    0 |    1 |     2 |
/// |         1 |    1 |    0 |     2 |
/// |         2 |    2 |    0 |     1 |
/// |         3 |    0 |    2 |     1 |
/// |         4 |    1 |    2 |     0 |
/// |         5 |    2 |    1 |     0 |
/// |___________|______|______|_______|
/// 
/// Each side of the BiLock can perform a single atomic operation: it can swap
/// its token with the free token.
/// 
/// For the LEFT side, by examining the table above, we can see that this
/// corresponds to the operation "XOR 1":
///     0 <=> 1
///     2 <=> 3
///     4 <=> 5
/// 
/// For the RIGHT side, by the same process we can see that this corresponds
/// to the operation "ADD 3 (mod 6)":
///     0 <=> 3
///     1 <=> 4
///     2 <=> 5
/// 
/// This yields a simple implementation of the swap operation for each side
/// of the BiLock: `state.fetch_xor(1, AcqRel)`, `state.fetch_add(3, AcqRel)`.
/// 
/// The "lock" operation
/// --------------------
/// To implement the "lock" operation, we must own token "0" or "1", or else we
/// would already have the lock. This gives us access to an entry in the
/// "tasks" array. We store the current task handle here in case we fail
/// to take the lock and need to be woken up.
/// 
/// Once we have stored the task handle, we perform the atomic swap, and
/// we check what token we got back. If we got back "2" then we succeeded
/// in taking the lock. Otherwise, we return NotReady, suspending the task.
/// If this occurs, the "FREE" token now contains our task handle.
/// 
/// The "unlock" operation
/// ----------------------
/// To implement the "unlock" operation, we must own token "2". We perform
/// the atomic swap operation, which results in the "FREE" token being "2"
/// (ie. the lock is not held by anyone). In exchange, we get back either
/// the "0" or "1" tokens.
/// 
/// At this point we must wake up the other side of the BiLock if it's
/// currently waiting on the lock. Conveniently, the token we just got
/// back gives us access to any task handle that was stored if the other
/// side suspended itself.
/// 
/// Optimisations
/// -------------
/// Obtaining the current task handle can be expensive, so the "lock"
/// implementation has a fast path which tries to take the lock without
/// storing a task handle. If this fails it simply tries to take the lock
/// again, this time storing a task handle. In the event that it fails that
/// second time, it returns NotReady.
/// 
/// Wrapping behaviour
/// ------------------
/// Since modular arithmatic is not a supported atomic operation, normal
/// addition is used in the "ADD 3 (mod 6)" operation. This results in the
/// `state` growing indefinitely. As a result, it must be protected from
/// wrapping around as it would naturally at a power of 2 determined by
/// the machine word size. After performing a lock, the side of the BiLock
/// which performs this addition checks if state is getting close to this
/// limit, and if so subtracts a large multiple of 6 to bring it back down
/// again.
